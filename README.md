# Graph Optimized Path Finding

Calculating the minimum cost and optimal path for a graph using BFS, DFS, and UCS in Artificial Intelligence.

Assignment @ Artificial Intelligence

## Algorithms

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores paths by going as deep as possible, useful for exploring all possible paths in a graph.
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**: Finds the least cost path in a weighted graph, expanding the least cost node first.
